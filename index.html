            <p class="p1"><span class="first-letter">H</span> ello, Panji here. I am a Bioengineer and a Programmer.
                Why a Bioengineer and a Programmer ? If I can do both, why not ?
                I graduated from Bandung Institute of Technology majoring in Bioengineering.
                Becoming a programmer is my passion. Those, who can't work for their passion, 
                will work in misery for their whole life. So, I live for my passion now.
            </p>
           
            <h2 id="story">My Story as Programmer</h2>
          
            <p class="p2"> 
                My skill in programming still sucks. That's why I need to learn many new things
                from experts. I accept any critiques and suggestions. Even if your language skills 
                still lacking (If You Know What I Mean). To become a Programmer, I need some basic skills.
                So I decided to apply at BBPLK Bekasi 3 months ago. For 2 months, I learnt Android Studio.
                The language that used is Java as back-end. For the front-end, XML was used. I learnt MySQL and 
                SQLite for database. Well, in my opinion the facility to support the lectures is very good, but 
                what I thought very lacking is the instructor. The instructor very often couldn't made it to 
                the class. The knowledge I gained from her, is very limited. I only learnt how to copy paste
                everything and then Voila, your program was running without knowing how the hell had I done -_-.
                At least, I got a certificate as Junior Mobile Programmer from BNSP (National Certification and
                Professional Institution). 
            </p>
            <p class="p3">
                After I finished from BBPLK Bekasi, I realized how shitty my skill is. I tried to look for 
                any Coding Bootcamp in order improving my skills. At first, I had doubts to enter a coding Bootcamp
                because of their admission fee is very expensive. After learning that Hacktiv8 have a scholarship
                offer, I tried to apply in their website. Hacktiv8 responded attentively to my application just
                in 3 days. We scheduled for logic test and interview with Hacktiv8 for a week later. The interviewer
                explained all detailed regarding the scholarship offer. She also asked about my personality and my 
                experiences in coding world. After interview, the interviewer which happened to be my overseer too, 
                gave me a piece of paper for answering and a bundle of question paper. The logic test consists of 
                multiple choices answer, one essay, and one translating paragraph from English to Bahasa Indonesia.
                The test spanned for 60 minutes. Two hour after the test, I got email which redirected to a grit test
                website. The day after, I got the result from Hacktiv8. I passed the first step and would had an interview 
                with KEB Hana Bank as the one who give the scholarship. In two days, I had an interview with them.
                The mistake that I made on the day of interview, I arrived 45 minutes earlier. I hoped that didn't affect 
                any bad impression. The interview held for 30 minutes. After that, I strolled around before went back home.
                The result from KEB Hana Bank took so long. After 10 days, I got a call from Hacktiv8 that informed me,
                I got the scholarship. And finally, here I'm at Hacktiv8. Hopefully, I survive in here and come out with ton of skills as a programmer.
